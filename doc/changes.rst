1.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

*Planned*: this release is intended for loading ``fuji`` and ``guadalupe`` with
all data files tagged.

0.9.0 (2023-02-08)
------------------

* Initial tag. Version number reflects the fact that extensive development
  was performed in the desispec_ package prior to moving code to this
  package.
* A test-load of ``fuji`` and ``guadalupe`` are visible on ``nerscdb03.nersc.gov``.
  This test-load uses the ``trunk`` version of fiberassign files, but otherwise
  should be identical to a final release version for those to specprods.
